Functional Programming in Scala Presentation @ DevCon7
======================================================

This code base supported a talk I gave on **Functional Programming in Scala** at DevCon7, an internal conference for BT 
 developers. The material is based on the knowledge I gained in completing the
 [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) course. 
 
[Slides](Functional%20Programming%20in%20Scala.pptx) are available.

The code breaks down as follows:

| Directory                                |                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------|
| src/fragments | Small code examples used to illustrate various Scala features                |
| src/demo      | A more comprehensive example, showing how Scala can be used to find anagrams |
| test/demo     | Scala tests to demonstrate anagram program.                                  |
